Discussions of popular responses to rising inequality have expanded in turn yet remain centered on support for explicit government redistribution of income from the rich to the poor. We argue that this focus may downwardly bias measurement of preferences for less inequality and propose an expanded framework that incorporates preferences regarding market institutions and policies that reduce labor market inequalities, which together can shed light on the public’s adherence to free market ideology. Empirically, we use original data to examine the US case, with a comparison to Sweden and Denmark. The results offer initial evidence of (1) the need for an expanded framework and research agenda in this field and (2) potentially broad-based support for policies that address economic inequality directly in the market sphere, contrary to key tenets of free market ideology.","2022-04-23","2023-04-25 20:12:56","2023-04-25 20:12:56","2023-04-25 20:12:56","mwac018","","","","","Socio-Economic Review","Bringing the market in","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\ZBPVE3DU\Lindh_McCall_2022_Bringing the market in.pdf; C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\IA7ECXPW\6573249.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attitudes towards Market Distribution of Social Services – A Comparison of 17 Countries","Social Policy & Administration","","1467-9515","10.1111/spol.12105","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spol.12105","This article studies how citizens view the appropriateness of market criteria for allocating services commonly associated with social citizenship rights and welfare state responsibility. The article focuses specifically on a potential role for the market in the provision of social services. The relationship between welfare policy institutions, socio-economic class and attitudes is explored by comparing attitudes across 17 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, using multilevel modelling and data from the 2009 International Social Survey Programme. Results show that public support for market distribution of services is relatively weak in most countries, a result suggesting that public opinion is unlikely to pose a driving force within ongoing processes of welfare marketization. Still, attitudes are found to vary a lot across countries in tandem with between-country variation in welfare policy design. First, aggregate public support for market distribution of services is stronger in countries with more private spending on services. Second, class differences in attitudes are larger in countries with more extensive state-led delivery of services. Together, these results point to the operation of normative feedback-effects flowing from existing welfare policy arrangements. The theoretical arguments and the empirical results presented in this article suggest that future research exploring the relationship between welfare policy and public opinion from a country-comparative perspective is well advised to place greater focus on the market institutions that, to varying extents in different countries, act as complements to the state in the administration of social welfare.","2015","2023-04-25 20:06:24","2023-04-25 20:06:24","2023-04-25 20:06:24","887-910","","7","49","","","Public Opinion against Markets?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spol.12105","","C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\4BGDHKX4\Lindh_2015_Public Opinion against Markets.pdf; C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\7SI33WQJ\spol.html","","","Inequality; Attitudes; Comparative analysis; Market; Public Opinion; Social services; Welfare state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While markets are dominant in modern capitalism, redistribution and reciprocity are—to varying extent—also part of its institutional architecture. Asking whether such institutional differences are mirrored in distinct ‘moral economies’, we investigate ordinary citizens’ support for market competition, redistribution and reciprocity across 14 capitalist economies. Combining data from three comparative surveys, we analyze, first, the extent to which these principles are supported by citizens and whether they cluster into distinct ‘moral economies’; second, whether these norms are anchored in formal institutional settings; and finally, how privileged and disadvantaged groups differ in their support. While support for market competition is strong across countries, it is to varying degrees complemented by support for redistribution and reciprocity. We identify a competition-dominated, an embedded and a strongly embedded moral economy. The interplay of formal institutions and people’s social–structural position partly explains differences in popular support.","2019-10-01","2024-02-06 20:59:49","2024-02-06 20:59:49","2024-02-06 20:59:49","793-821","","4","17","","Socio-Economic Review","The moral economies of market societies","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\LDCCVUG3\Koos y Sachweh - 2019 - The moral economies of market societies popular a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This means that we acan expect groups with higher-class positions to be more positiive than workers towards the market”</p> <p>As follows, this assumtions have some complications:</p> <p>1) Attitudes are not pure self-interest. They are the product of a more complex a composito “moral economy” that centers on notions of reasonableness (a) and justice (b) in different social social settings (Svallvors 1996, Mau, 2003: Ch 3). It is possible that the disprivileged can also accept a certain measure of distribution if it is seen as reasonable outcome (c) of fair procedures (d) </p> <p>2) En contraste con la política, esl mercado es algo que se da por echo - esto incluye sus naturaleza operacional como también sus distributive properties are much less connected to how accountability in politics works. Then, the markets is something that “just happens” or it can be considered as an espontaneous self-organized system. An important matter in this argument is that the distribtion of the market can be assumed as “given”, unchangeable phenomenon: the market apportions its resources in an arbitratry and automatic manner and if we are unhappy with our lot, there is noauthority to wich the public can complain. In contrast, politics thing works differently: electoral ruls bring accountability to the table and allows voter to express disatisfaction if representor fail in their promises or behave innapropiately. Lane argues that we tend to see market distribution as an expression of individual input and personal credit. The social forces behind it are quite simple not as visible as they are in politics. If lane is right, I should not expect stronger differences beteewwn classes or socioeconomic groups - What is defined as “market fatalism” would eradicate any class-differences in market preferences, leaving market distributions to enjoy stable and permanent legitimacy.</p> <p>3) Another complications refereces to the instituional framing of national markets that chancges considerably from country to another. This is an interesting point, as I am investigating the Chilean case. Self-regulating market are nothing but a Liberal utopia. Thus, as real markets need institutions to regulated them, otherwise they can be slowly subverted by their own internal dynamics (Polanyi 1994; Granovetter 1985: Fligstein 2001) For example, for markets to function properly, a legal framework is needed to protect property rights and to regulate and sanction them. However, in order for markets to fulfill their function, there are different ways in which markets become institutionally embedded, and this is where different political economies differ. This includes how wages are regulated (1), the institutional bargaining capabilities between sellers and buyers of labor (2), and the nature of relations between unions and employers (3)</p> <p>These conditions are often loosly found in the forms of integrated “regimes” because they depende on internal connections between differen aspects. A different way of organizing this is by position market economies in the axis of “coordinated” versus “liberal” (Soskice, 1999; Hall and Soskice 2001). Here, coordinated market economies have regulated labor markets, financial systems that allow far-sighted planning, and advance cooperation and negotiation systems beteen businesses as well as between unions and employers. Liberal market economies have lower labor market regulations, financial systems preoccupied with immediate gains and stock market prices, competition-based relations between companies and weak systems for collective barganing (Soskice, 1999). </p> <ul> <li> Gemany an Sweden represent cases of coordinated market economies </li> <li> United States and the UK, the coordination is almost absent </li> </ul> <p>The paper discuss to opposing hypothesis. </p> <p>H1a: Since income distribution is very much the object of discussion and negotiation in the coordinated market economies, it is here that we will fin the most salient class differences. We can hardly expect to finds Lane’s “market fatalism” (that the market enjoys of present extended legitimacy between classes in countries where income distribution is as politicized as it is in the coordinated market economies. On the other hand, it might be possibly stronger in countries such as Britain and the US, where wage levels are the result of impersonally operative market forces. &nbsp;</p> <p>H1b: Since actual income gaps are much wider and have grown much more quickly in Britain and the US than in Sweden and Germany, they are much more likely to trigger - class antagonism - in these liberal market economies. The workers have more to gain and the upper manuals more to lose from redistribution in countries where inequality is greater. If this is one of the instruments behind the formation of attitudes towards income distribution, we would also expect to find greater class differences in Britain and the United states than in Sweden and Germany.</p> <p>Another issue of the paper is to observe how class differences in attitudes towards the market change over time. One dimension is pay differentials, particularly in Britain and the United States. Does this also polarize attitudes more between classes? Another assumption is that the lower classes are more skeptical of market distribution. Worth noticing that one dimension is pay differentials between occupations (pay ratios) and other is about the income distribution or the causes of inequality.</p> <p>An additional aspect is what do different classes in each country “believe that money should buy?” Is it fair that people on high incomes use their greater wealth to purchase better healthcare or better schooling for their children?</p> <p></p> <p></p> </div>","","","","","Svallfors, Stefan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a nationally representative sample in the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes, we examined the public's fairness perceptions of income-based educational inequality and how their fairness perceptions are related to self-interest (particularly regarding social class) and ideological orientations. We found that people hold diverse views about the fairness of income-based educational inequality and that the number of people who perceived it as unfair was almost double the number of those who perceived it as fair. Respondents categorised as upper/upper-middle-class were, however, more likely to perceive income-based educational inequality as fair, while agreement with government responsibility for economic well-being was associated with a negative view of income-based educational inequality.

One potential consequence of such ideals is the legitimization of outcome inequalities across various spheres, including those traditionally associated with equality and redistribution. In this study, we argue that the promotion of meritocratic values during school age can shape students’ beliefs about meritocracy and influence their views on market-based access to health, pensions, and education. Using data from the 2017 National Study of Civic Education in Chile, which includes 5047 eighth-grade students from 231 schools, we estimated a series of multilevel models (lme4 library, R version 4.1.3) to test our hypotheses. Our findings show that a significant proportion of Chilean students agree with market justice principles—more so than adults. Most students endorse meritocratic views, particularly the notion that effort should be rewarded, which strongly correlates with market justice preferences: students who believe in meritocracy are more likely to justify inequalities based on financial capacity. At the school level, market justice preferences are higher in high-status schools but lower in schools with higher academic achievement. Furthermore, the conditional influence of meritocratic beliefs diminishes in schools with higher socioeconomic status and performance levels. These results suggest that the association between meritocratic beliefs and market justice preferences is already established at school age and is shaped by the school environment.","2024-11","2024-10-24 09:18:21","2024-10-24 09:18:21","2024-10-24 09:18:21","214","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\jiturra\Zotero\storage\6ADJB5M7\Castillo et al. - 2024 - The Socialization of Meritocracy and Market Justic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These preferences have structural roots in the way governments and markets serve different values and purposes, satisfy wants, focus on fairness or justice, enlist causal attributions, distribute or redistribute income, are limited by rights, and seem to offer either harmony or conflict of interest. Some of these “structural” differences, however, are themselves perceptual, and corrected by changed perceptions of the productivity of government and of our historic predecessors, and by a community point of view involving changed accounting systems, as well as by policies of full employment rather than guaranteed incomes.
